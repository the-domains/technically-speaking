While studying cinema, I was also being paid for web design and tinkering with PCs.

My passion for technology is as old as my love of media, and has its first steps in Super Mario World. My unusual mix of disciplines and avoidance of standard education (my worst GCSE at 16 was in IT) means I have something to prove.

I never feel satisfied with my current knowledge, and always suspect I'm lagging behind anyone who had a Computer Science degree. I'm also told my unusual introduction to IT means I have a different perspective on things, but I reckon that's a chicken and egg situation if ever there was one...

This _"small fish - big ocean"_ scenario was never around when I was building PCs for video editing, and using the limited range of effects to layer and develop new forms of digital video... I had no one to compare myself against other than mathematicians, as my internet presence was all but non-existent. Now, I have a chip on my shoulder, examples of the best and worst of my peers in this profession, and the tantalising taste that there's always something just around the corner.

The "IT wizard" may as well be a self-invented moniker, as there's a pair of elements at play. That theme of the recluse - some sage like being residing in a distant, dark abode, devoid of life's usual trappings (like sunlight). And then the real part that appeals to techies is the magic. A computer is empty and void until there's something running on it. Its an engine without diesel.

Manipulating the minds fancies and sweat, conjuring it into something corporeal that can feed this **species defining machine **can be so tantalising... because the possibilities are manifold and endless.

_[Aaron Schwartz][0]_ was a young co-founder of what we think of as reddit, helping them gain traction as a company. He also worked on RSS technology, and was a public speaker at lectures while in his early teens. He sadly is no longer with us, and died at 26, already having achieved so much.

He put the idea of code as magic in my mind... he felt empowered knowing that there was no problem in the world that couldn't be helped or solved outright by working on the internet, from your bedroom or anywhere in the world. And like many other peers, he saw education as the most important part of whatever world we build next. But not one that ends at school, rather one that keeps knowledge and learning as a free public service for all.

The other moral of Aaron's story for me, is that he embodies a living opposition to the misconception that technology is inevitably improving. The incrementally increasing model numbers, the higher stats for screens and processors, batteries and prices all give the illusion of inevitable progression. The reality is that the engine remains nothing without the fuel to drive it. And the inspiration for me at the end of all this is knowing my weaknesses and failings, knowing that I'll never match my peers innate skills, or brilliant ideas... but also knowing that there is no guarantee of a brighter future unless we work on it together.

At their base, computers work with 0s and 1s. As we move up the "technology stack" and add in monitors, keyboards wifi networks and apps, there are more and more many thousands of minds that have been united in making the concepts we use day in day out, without us even thinking about them.

**Those base technologies, very rarely make mistakes. **Instead, it's the person who made the an implementation - an "application" - who can make a mistake or not predict a human action, and make _"bad programming"_.

So in our own little ways we can all help to improve this magnificent behemoth of interconnected machinery that - in its muddled way - runs the world more than any President.

That's why I love technology.
